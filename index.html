We get into every possible location of the house, whether it's in the crawlspace, on the main floors for carpet and structural	drying, or the de-humidification of the air to prevent that from damaging the walls.</p>

					<p>The owner, Ron Barnes, was a lifesaver! We had a flood on Sunday night and he came right over. He took care of everything, staying late into the night until everything was in place. He was able to have the areas dry in four days.</p>
					<p> I hope I never have this problem again, but if I do, I'll know who to call.</p>
